## Introduction

Depression is a prevalent mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for better outcomes. This project leverages Python and machine learning to create a system that can analyze textual data, such as social media posts or survey responses, to identify signs of depression.

## Features

## Usage

To use the Depression Detection System:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from users or relevant sources, such as social media posts or surveys.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to clean and format it for analysis.

3. **Run the System**: Execute the system, providing the preprocessed data as input.

4. **Results**: The system will output results indicating the likelihood of depression.

Please note that this system is intended for research and educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.

## Dataset
You can access the dataset used in this project by following this [Suicide and Depression Detection
 ]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch?fbclid=IwAR1dNFNpod_tQCAV6iaBmoBDMSEq-5_LERu1xsTaydG8gNnS-KcdvB2Li54).  
 **About Dataset**

The dataset is a collection of posts from the "SuicideWatch" and "depression" subreddits of the Reddit platform. The posts are collected using Pushshift API. All posts that were made to "SuicideWatch" from Dec 16, 2008(creation) till Jan 2, 2021, were collected while "depression" posts were collected from Jan 1, 2009, to Jan 2, 2021. All posts collected from SuicideWatch are labeled as suicide, While posts collected from the depression subreddit are labeled as depression. Non-suicide posts are collected from r/teenagers.
